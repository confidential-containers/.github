## Welcome to confidential-containers

Confidential Containers is an open source community working to enable cloud native confidential 
computing by leveraging 
[Trusted Execution Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) to 
protect containers and data.

Goals:
- Allow cloud native application owners to enforce application security requirements
- Transparent deployment of unmodified containers
- Support for multiple TEE and hardware platforms
- A trust model which separates Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) from guest applications
- Least privilege principles for the Kubernetes Cluster administration capabilities which impact 
delivering Confidential Computing for guest application or data inside the TEE.
