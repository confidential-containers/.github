## Welcome to Confidential Containers

Confidential Containers is an open source community working to enable cloud native confidential 
computing by leveraging 
[Trusted Execution Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) to 
protect containers and data.

**Release v0.1.0 is Live!**
See [Release Notes](https://github.com/confidential-containers/documentation/blob/main/releases/v0.1.0.md)
or [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/confidential-containers/documentation/blob/v0.1.0/quickstart.md)

Goals:
- Allow cloud native application owners to enforce application security requirements
- Transparent deployment of unmodified containers
- Support for multiple TEE and hardware platforms
- A trust model which separates Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) from guest applications
- Least privilege principles for the Kubernetes Cluster administration capabilities which impact 
delivering Confidential Computing for guest application or data inside the TEE.
